# Preserving Connections: Context-Engineered Grief-Tech Platform

## Quick Start for Developers
This system follows context engineering principles over prompt engineering.
All agents implement behavioral contracts defined in `specs/agent-contracts.ts`.

## Implementation Order
1. Week 1-2: Sub-agent interfaces and context orchestrator
2. Week 3-4: Memory curator and persona engine  
3. Week 5-6: Safety monitor and family coordinator
4. Week 7-8: Integration and scaling

## Critical Principles
- Specifications before implementation
- Safety as core architecture  
- Context compression for scalability
- Emotional consistency validation
