❓Frequently Asked Questions
💬 What exactly is Evermore?

Evermore lets you create a digital memory of someone you love. Using audio, video, and written memories, we build an interactive avatar that sounds like them, speaks like them, and reflects how they communicated.

🧠 Is this meant to replace someone who’s passed away?

Absolutely not. Evermore is about honoring and preserving. Just like saving voicemails or watching old home videos — except now, those moments can talk back.

🎙️ What can the AI actually do?

You can ask it questions, talk about your day, or simply listen to them speak. The AI is trained on how your loved one spoke — their tone, beliefs, quirks, and phrases — to make the experience feel familiar and comforting.

💔 Is this emotionally healthy?

For many people, yes. We’re building this with licensed grief counselors and therapists to ensure it supports — not replaces — the healing process. For some, it’s a digital form of remembrance and comfort. For others, it may not be the right fit. And that’s okay.

🙏 Isn’t this “playing God”?

That’s something we’ve wrestled with, too. But Evermore doesn’t create new memories — it simply preserves the presence that already existed. This is no different than watching old videos on loop — only now, the loop listens.

🔐 What about privacy and data security?

Privacy is sacred. All content you upload is encrypted, never shared, and stays in your control. We don’t use your memories to train public AI models. What’s yours stays yours.

💸 Is this just a gimmick?

Not at all. Evermore was created from real loss, not venture capital hype. We don’t see this as a product — we see it as a tool for peace, for storytelling, for healing. This isn’t about novelty. It’s about meaning.

👪 Can I use Evermore for someone who’s still alive?

Absolutely. In fact, many families use it before loss to preserve someone’s voice, humor, and perspective — especially elderly parents or grandparents — so their presence can be passed down.

🎁 What kind of memories can I use to build a persona?

Voice messages, videos, old podcasts, social posts, interview footage, even casual conversations. The more authentic the source, the more lifelike the digital memory becomes.
