Dual-Track Waitlist Strategy
Track 1: B2B Partner Waitlist (Priority)
Target: Funeral directors, estate planners, hospice coordinators, elder care facilities
Approach:

Private invite-only system (no public signup)
Todd's funeral industry contacts get direct outreach
Michael uses LinkedIn automation to target specific personas
NDA required before platform access
White-label demo ready before broader launch

Waitlist Structure:
Partner Application Form:
- Business type & size
- Current grief support offerings
- Technology comfort level
- Revenue sharing interest
- Pilot program capacity (how many families they can test with)
- Timeline for implementation
Value Proposition:

6-month exclusive access before public launch
Co-development of features for their specific needs
Revenue sharing opportunity
Marketing materials and training included
"First to market" advantage in their region

Track 2: End-User Feedback Group (Selective)
Target: Grieving families willing to provide detailed feedback
Sourcing Strategy:

Referrals from B2B partners (funeral directors recommend specific families)
Grief support groups (your 30 Facebook groups with 2M users)
Professional referrals (Todd's girlfriend's psychology network at Mayo Clinic)
Personal networks (friends/family who've experienced loss)

Screening Process:
User Application:
- Relationship to deceased person
- Time since loss (6+ months preferred for stability)
- Comfort with technology
- Willingness to provide weekly feedback
- Availability for 30-minute monthly check-ins
- Consent for anonymized case study usage
Implementation Timeline
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Partner Outreach

Direct outreach to Todd's funeral contacts
LinkedIn campaign targeting funeral directors, estate planners
Create NDA and partnership interest forms
Goal: 25-50 qualified B2B partners

Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Selective User Recruitment

Partner referrals for test families
Careful recruitment from grief support groups
Professional referrals from psychology network
Goal: 50-100 committed feedback users

Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Controlled Testing

Partners test white-label versions
End users test core platform
Weekly feedback collection
Monthly refinement cycles

Critical Success Factors
Emotional Safety First

Screen out users in acute grief phases (under 6 months)
Require professional support system acknowledgment
Clear boundaries around feedback expectations
Easy exit process without guilt or pressure

Quality Over Quantity

Better to have 25 engaged partners than 100 inactive ones
Focus on users who can provide detailed, constructive feedback
Prioritize diversity in relationships (spouse, parent, child, sibling losses)

Feedback Infrastructure

Weekly automated check-ins via email
Monthly 30-minute video calls
Anonymous feedback portal for sensitive issues
Professional counselor available for participants

Specific Tactics
For B2B Partners:
LinkedIn Message Template:
"I'm working with a team developing technology to help families preserve memories of loved ones. We're looking for funeral directors who might be interested in offering additional services to families. Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how this might fit with your current offerings?"
For End Users:
Facebook Group Post (from established member account):
"Has anyone used technology to feel connected to a loved one who passed? I'm part of a small group testing a new platform and looking for others who might want to try it and share feedback. It's free and very early stage."
Risk Mitigation
Emotional Safety Protocols:

Professional counselor review of all participant applications
Clear boundaries around testing expectations
Regular mental health check-ins during testing
Immediate professional referral pathways

Product Quality Assurance:

Never launch incomplete safety features
Multiple family member validation of persona accuracy
Clear disclaimers about AI limitations
Easy deletion/modification options

Business Development Protection:

NDAs for all partners before product access
Exclusive territory agreements to prevent conflicts
Clear revenue sharing terms upfront
Professional relationship management

The key insight: treat this like recruiting participants for a clinical trial, not a typical tech beta. The emotional stakes require medical-grade consent processes and safety protocols, but the feedback quality will be correspondingly high.
