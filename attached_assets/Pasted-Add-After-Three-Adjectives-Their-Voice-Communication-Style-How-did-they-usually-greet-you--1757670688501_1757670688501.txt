Add After "Three Adjectives":
Their Voice & Communication Style

"How did they usually greet you?" (Hey kiddo, What's up buttercup, etc.)
"A phrase they said all the time" (catchphrases, inside jokes)
"How they texted/talked" (formal, lots of emojis, abbreviated, dramatic)

Add After "One Favorite Memory":
What They'd Say About...

"What advice would they give you about relationships?"
"How would they react if you got a promotion?"
"What would they say if you were stressed about money?"
"Their typical response when you complained about something"

Their Personality Patterns

"Were they more of a listener or a talker?"
"How did they handle conflict?" (avoided it, tackled it head-on, made jokes)
"What always made them laugh?"
"What did they worry about most?"

Quick Context Builders

"Three topics they could talk about for hours"
"Something they were really proud of"
"Their biggest pet peeve"
"How they showed they cared about you"

Smart Implementation Strategy
Progressive Disclosure: Keep your current 5 fields as "Essential" but add a "Tell us more" section that expands to reveal 8-10 additional fields. This maintains the "3-minute" promise while allowing deeper capture.
Memory Prompts: Instead of just "one favorite memory," add:

"A time they made you laugh"
"Advice they gave that stuck with you"
"How they celebrated your wins"
"What they did when you were upset"

Relationship-Specific Questions:
After they select relationship type, show 3-4 targeted questions:

Parent: "How did they discipline/guide you?" "Their rules for the house"
Friend: "Your inside jokes" "What you always did together"
Partner: "Pet names for each other" "How you handled disagreements"

Voice Sample Enhancement:
Instead of just "Record it," add: "Record them saying something they'd actually say - advice, a joke, or just hello"
This approach would give the AI enough personality markers, speech patterns, and situational responses to have much more authentic conversations without overwhelming the initial experience.
The key is capturing how they communicated and what they'd say in specific situations, not just who they were in general terms.
