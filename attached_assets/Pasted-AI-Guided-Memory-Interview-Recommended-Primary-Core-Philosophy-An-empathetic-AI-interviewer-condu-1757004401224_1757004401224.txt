AI-Guided Memory Interview" (Recommended Primary)
Core Philosophy
An empathetic AI interviewer conducts a natural conversation to extract memories, automatically building the persona in real-time while providing therapeutic value through the sharing process itself.
Onboarding Flow
Pre-Interview Setup (2 minutes)
"I'm Sarah, and I'll be helping you share memories of [Name]. 
This will feel like talking to a friend who truly wants to understand who they were.
We can pause anytime, and everything you share stays private until you decide otherwise."

Basic info: Name, relationship, photo upload
Emotional check-in: "How are you feeling about sharing today?"
The Interview Experience (20-45 minutes, can be split across sessions)
Opening Questions (Natural conversation starter):

"Tell me about the first time you remember really laughing with [Name]"
"What's a typical Saturday afternoon with them look like?"
"If [Name] walked into this room right now, what would they say?"

AI Follow-up Intelligence:
User: "Dad always made pancakes on Sunday mornings"

AI Sarah: "That sounds like such a special tradition. What made his pancakes different? 
Did he have any funny habits while cooking? Who else was usually there for Sunday pancakes?"
Dynamic Persona Building:

AI identifies personality traits in real-time ("I'm hearing that your dad was very generous")
Asks clarifying questions ("When you say he was stubborn, can you give me an example?")
Builds voice patterns ("Did he have any favorite phrases or expressions?")
Maps relationships ("How was he different with your mom versus with you kids?")

Emotional Safety Protocols:

Detects emotional distress and offers breaks
Validates difficult emotions ("That sounds incredibly painful to lose him so suddenly")
Gently redirects if unhealthy patterns emerge
Offers professional resources if needed

Live Persona Testing (10 minutes)
"Based on what you've shared, I've created an early version of your dad. 
Would you like to try talking to him? Remember, he'll get better as we add more memories."
